# SmartExcel-SalesOrdreManagement

Purpose: The logistics team uses Excel to record all their orders to be fulfilled and each week they need to send the order fulfilment status of different customers to the corresponding account manager in a separate report and analyse the presentation of the order fulfilment status, they need to automate this part  

Solution: Write Marco scripts using Visual basic application to:
1. automatically split the orders of different customers
2. sort orders with different levels of completion and colour the cells differently
